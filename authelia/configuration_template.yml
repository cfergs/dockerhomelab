#
# There are two supported backends: 'ldap' and 'file'.
authentication_backend:
  # Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality
  disable_reset_password: false

  # LDAP backend configuration.
  #
  # This backend allows Authelia to be scaled to more
  # than one instance and therefore is recommended for
  # production.
  ldap:
    # The url to the ldap server. Scheme can be ldap:// or ldaps://
    url: ldap://ldap

    # Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow self-signed certificate).
    skip_verify: true

    # The base dn for every entries
    base_dn: dc=example,dc=com

    # The attribute holding the username of the user. This attribute is used to populate
    # the username in the session information. It was introduced due to #561 to handle case
    # insensitive search queries.
    # For you information, Microsoft Active Directory usually uses 'sAMAccountName' and OpenLDAP
    # usually uses 'uid'
    # Beware that this attribute holds the unique identifiers for the users binding the user and the configuration
    # stored in database. Therefore only single value attributes are allowed and the value
    # must never be changed once attributed to a user otherwise it would break the configuration
    # for that user. Technically, non-unique attributes like 'mail' can also be used but we don't recommend using
    # them, we instead advise to use the attributes mentioned above (sAMAccountName and uid) to follow
    # https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt. 
    username_attribute: uid

    # An additional dn to define the scope to all users

    # The users filter used in search queries to find the user profile based on input filled in login form.
    # Various placeholders are available to represent the user input and back reference other options of the configuration:
    # - {input} is a placeholder replaced by what the user inputs in the login form. 
    # - {username_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `username_attribute`.
    # - {mail_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `mail_attribute`.
    # - DON'T USE - {0} is an alias for {input} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later versions, so please don't use it.

# Access Control
#
# Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one
# resource to users or group of users.
#
# If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'bypass'
# rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow
# the rules defined.
#
# Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
# It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
#
# Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML
# to be syntactically correct.
#
# Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject',
# 'policy' and 'resources'.
#
# - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
#
# - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is
#    optional and matching any user if not provided. If provided, the parameter
#    represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form 'user:<username>'
#    or 'group:<groupname>'.
#
# - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass',
#   'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
#
# - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to
#    apply the policy to. This parameter is optional and matches any resource if not
#    provided.
#
# Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching
# (domain, resource, subject) applies.
access_control:
  # Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
  # It is the policy applied to any resource if there is no policy to be applied
  # to the user.
  default_policy: deny

  rules:
    - domain: auth.example.com
      policy: one_factor

    - domain: example.com

# Configuration of session cookies
#
# The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
session:
# The name of the session cookie. (default: authelia_session).
  name: authelia_session

  # The secret to encrypt the session data. This is only used with Redis.
  # Secret can also be set using a secret: https://docs.authelia.com/configuration/secrets.html
  #secret: insecure_session_secret

  # The time in seconds before the cookie expires and session is reset.
  expiration: 1h

  # The inactivity time in seconds before the session is reset.
  inactivity: 5m

  # The remember me duration.
  # Value of 0 disables remember me.
  # Value is in seconds, or duration notation. See: https://docs.authelia.com/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
  # Longer periods are considered less secure because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to spy
  # or attack. Currently the default is 1M or 1 month.
  remember_me_duration: 1M

  # The domain to protect.
  # Note: the authenticator must also be in that domain. If empty, the cookie
  # is restricted to the subdomain of the issuer.
  domain: example.com

  # The redis connection details
  #redis:
    #host: 127.0.0.1

    # This is the Redis DB Index https://redis.io/commands/select (sometimes referred to as database number, DB, etc).
    #database_index: 0

# Configuration of the authentication regulation mechanism.
#
# This mechanism prevents attackers from brute forcing the first factor.
# It bans the user if too many attempts are done in a short period of
# time.
regulation:
  # The number of failed login attempts before user is banned.
  # Set it to 0 to disable regulation.
  max_retries: 3

  # The time range during which the user can attempt login before being banned.
  # The user is banned if the authentication failed 'max_retries' times in a 'find_time' seconds window.
  # Find Time accepts duration notation. See: https://docs.authelia.com/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
  find_time: 2m

  # The length of time before a banned user can login again.
  # Ban Time accepts duration notation. See: https://docs.authelia.com/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format

# Configuration of the storage backend used to store data and secrets.
#
# You must use only an available configuration: local, mysql, postgres
storage:
  # The directory where the DB files will be saved
  local:
    path: /var/lib/authelia/db.sqlite3

  # Settings to connect to MySQL server

# Configuration of the notification system.
#
# Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a u2f
# registration or a TOTP registration.
# Use only an available configuration: filesystem, smtp.
notifier:
  # You can disable the notifier startup check by setting this to true.
  disable_startup_check: false

  # For testing purpose, notifications can be sent in a file
  #filesystem:
  #  filename: /tmp/authelia/notification.txt

  # Use a SMTP server for sending notifications. Authelia uses PLAIN or LOGIN method to authenticate.
  # [Security] By default Authelia will:
  #   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections
  #      - use the disable_require_tls boolean value to disable this requirement (only works for unauthenticated connections)
  #   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - trusted_cert option:
  #       - this is a string value, that may specify the path of a PEM format cert, it is completely optional
  #       - if it is not set, a blank string, or an invalid path; will still trust the host machine/containers cert store
  #     - defaults to the host machine (or docker container's) trusted certificate chain for validation
  #     - use the trusted_cert string value to specify the path of a PEM format public cert to trust in addition to the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - use the disable_verify_cert boolean value to disable the validation (prefer the trusted_cert option as it's more secure)
